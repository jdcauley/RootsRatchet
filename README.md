RootsRatchet
============

<a href="http://rootstheme.com" target="_blank">RootsTheme</a> Plus <a href="http://maker.github.com/ratchet" target="_blank">Ratchet.js</a>

Super Mobile WP theme, so mobile in fact, that it can't be used on most desktops.

Still in early development it works but isn't all that pretty.

Built on Roots theme it retains clean code output and excellent URLS.

There will be more here.

Contact me with questions. I'm jdcauley on Github and Twitter.
